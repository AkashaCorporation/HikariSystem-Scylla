## [3.5.4] - 2026-02-19 - "Stability & Isolation"

> **Bugfix, Stability, & Validation Release** — x64 ELF emulation crash fix via worker process isolation, intelligent IPC string memory synchronization, advanced custom VM CTF challenge validation, and memory region size correction.

### Fixed

- **Worker/Host Memory Desync** — Fixed a critical issue where the Node.js `x64ElfWorker` would dynamically modify the heap (e.g., decrypting strings) but the Host's HexCore instance couldn't read those strings when evaluating API hooks like `__printf_chk`.
- **Smart Memory Sync** — Implemented "Smart Sync" in `unicornWrapper.ts`. Before every API hook execution, HexCore instantly synchronizes 1024 bytes around argument pointers (`RDI`, `RSI`, `RDX`, `RCX`) from the Worker to the Host.
- **RSP Stack Synchronization** — Fixed a bug where `popReturnAddressSync` read stale Host stack memory instead of real stack written by the Worker. RSP is now continuously synced prior to hook validation.
- **x64 ELF emuStart crash (STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION)** — Unicorn's x64 ELF emulation caused `0xC0000374` heap corruption in the Electron extension host. Fix: x64 ELF emulation now runs in a dedicated child process (`x64ElfWorker.js`) communicating via JSON-RPC.
- **Unicorn `memRegions()` size calculation** — Fixed `end` field from Unicorn being inclusive instead of exclusive. Size is now `end - begin + 1n`.
- **Entropy Analyzer** — Fixed webview not updating and missing "Open File" button.

### Added

- **`getline` API Hook** — Implemented a robust `getline` hook in `linuxApiHooks.ts` utilizing `this.memoryManager.heapAlloc` to dynamically allocate and fetch inputs from `stdinBuffer`.
- **`__printf_chk` String Mapping** — Extended the `__printf_chk` hook to properly serialize its string formatting logic and propagate to the headless pipeline's `stdout`.
- **CTF Validation** — Verified that HexCore effortlessly executes over 19,000 instructions from advanced custom VM challenges, gracefully bypassing `ptrace` anti-dbg checks and evaluating dozens of sub-VM loops in headless automation mode.
- **x64 ELF Worker Client & Worker** — Standalone Node.js process and IPC client handling Unicorn state.
- **Debugger headless emulation commands** — 5 new pipeline-safe commands: `emulateFullHeadless`, `writeMemoryHeadless`, `setRegisterHeadless`, `setStdinHeadless`, `disposeHeadless`.

### Fixed

- **x64 ELF emuStart crash (STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION)** — Unicorn's x64 ELF emulation caused `0xC0000374` heap corruption in the Electron extension host process. Root cause: Unicorn's internal memory management conflicts with Electron's V8 heap. Fix: replicated the ARM64 worker pattern — x64 ELF emulation now runs in a dedicated child process (`x64ElfWorker.js`) communicating via JSON-RPC over IPC. The worker spawns automatically when `setElfSyncMode(true)` is called for x64 architecture, migrating all Unicorn state (memory regions, register values) to the isolated process.
- **Unicorn `memRegions()` size calculation** — `end` field from Unicorn is **inclusive** (last valid byte), so region size must be `end - begin + 1`, not `end - begin`. The off-by-one caused `UC_ERR_ARG` (code 15) during worker state migration because Unicorn rejected unaligned sizes (e.g., 4095 instead of 4096 for a page). Fixed in `setElfSyncMode` migration loop.
- **`getMemoryRegions()` display size** — cosmetic fix in 3 code paths (ARM64 worker, x64 ELF worker, in-process) to use `end - begin + 1n` for correct region size display.
- **Entropy Analyzer webview not updating on second run** — CSP `nonce-${nonce}` doesn't work in VS Code sidebar webviews. Changed to `'unsafe-inline'` (same fix as PE Analyzer). Also added re-send of cached analysis data when webview is recreated.
- **Entropy Analyzer missing "Open File" button** — added file picker button to toolbar, bypassing `getActiveFileUri()` logic.

### Added

- **x64 ELF Worker Client** (`x64ElfWorkerClient.ts`) — IPC client that manages the child process lifecycle. Supports: `initialize`, `mapMemory`, `memWrite`, `memRead`, `regWrite`, `regRead`, `emuStart`, `emuStop`, `memRegions`, `contextSave`, `contextRestore`, `addHook`, `dispose`. BigInt values serialized with `BI:` prefix for JSON transport.
- **x64 ELF Worker** (`x64ElfWorker.js`) — standalone Node.js process that loads `hexcore-unicorn` and executes Unicorn operations in isolation. Handles all emulation lifecycle including hook callbacks via IPC.
- **Debugger headless emulation commands** — 5 new pipeline-safe commands: `emulateFullHeadless`, `writeMemoryHeadless`, `setRegisterHeadless`, `setStdinHeadless`, `disposeHeadless`. All registered in `COMMAND_CAPABILITIES`, `COMMAND_OWNERS`, and `COMMAND_ALIASES`.

### Removed

- **ARM64 heartbeat DIAG** — removed diagnostic `setTimeout` heartbeat logging from `startEmulation` (was temporary crash detection aid, no longer needed).
- **DIAG code in extension.ts** — removed diagnostic instrumentation from debugger extension entry point.

### Backlog Items Resolved

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| N/A | x64 ELF worker process isolation (crash fix) |
| N/A | memRegions size calculation fix (UC_ERR_ARG) |
| N/A | Entropy analyzer webview + Open File button |

## [3.5.3] - 2026-02-18 - "Quality & Polish"

> **Maintenance Release** — Developer experience improvements, Issue #8 resolution, and documentation overhaul.

### Fixed

- **Preinstall robustness** — `build/npm/preinstall.ts` `installHeaders()` now uses `--ignore-scripts` flag, 60-second timeout, and clear error messages when `npm ci` fails in `build/npm/gyp/`. Prevents the interactive shell hang reported in Issue #8.
- **Report Composer outDir resolution** — `composeReport` now resolves the reports directory from: (1) explicit `reportsDir` argument, (2) `output.path` parent directory (pipeline outDir), (3) default `hexcore-reports/`. Previously it was hardcoded to `hexcore-reports/` which failed when the pipeline used a custom `outDir`.

### Added

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Complete contributor guide with prerequisites, quick start, project structure, test instructions, extension creation guide, code style reference, native engine development notes, and PR process.

### Improved

- **DEVELOPMENT.md** — Added "Important Notes" section at top with `VSCODE_SKIP_NODE_VERSION_CHECK` requirement, prebuild auto-download clarification, and preinstall troubleshooting.

### Issue #8 Resolution

All 5 items from @YasminePayload's build process report are now resolved. Full credit to **@YasminePayload** for the incredibly detailed bug report that directly improved HexCore's build system reliability and developer experience.

> **Feature Release** — Full pipeline maturity: every analytical capability in HexCore is now accessible programmatically. New ELF Analyzer, Report Composer, multi-byte XOR deobfuscation, and headless commands for Debugger, Base64, and Hex Viewer.

### Added

- **Debugger Headless — Snapshot & Restore** — `hexcore.debug.snapshotHeadless` and `hexcore.debug.restoreSnapshotHeadless` commands for pipeline-driven emulation state management.
- **API/Lib Call Trace** — `TraceManager` captures API/libc calls with arguments, return values, and PC addresses during emulation. New `TraceTreeProvider` panel for real-time visualization. `hexcore.debug.exportTraceHeadless` for pipeline export.
- **ELF Analyzer** (`hexcore-elfanalyzer`) — New extension for structural analysis of ELF binaries. TypeScript-pure parser supporting ELF32/ELF64, section/segment/symbol parsing, dynamic linking info, and security mitigations (RELRO, Stack Canary, NX, PIE). Commands: `hexcore.elfanalyzer.analyze`, `hexcore.elfanalyzer.analyzeActive`.
- **Report Composer** (`hexcore-report-composer`) — New extension that aggregates pipeline outputs from `hexcore-reports/` directory into a unified Markdown report with table of contents, evidence links, and analyst notes. Command: `hexcore.pipeline.composeReport`.
- **Base64 Headless** — `hexcore.base64.decodeHeadless` command for pipeline-driven Base64 string extraction from binary files.
- **Multi-byte XOR Deobfuscation** — Extended `hexcore.strings.extractAdvanced` with multi-byte XOR keys (2, 4, 8, 16 bytes), rolling XOR, and XOR with increment detection. Frequency analysis-based key recovery.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-02-16 - "ARM64 Fix"

> **Bugfix Release** — Complete ARM/ARM64 support across disassembler, debugger, strings, and formula engines. Previously, ARM64 binaries were effectively unreadable. Tested against HTB Insane-level ARM64 ELF: 72 functions discovered (was 1).

### Fixed

- **Capstone ARM64 instruction classification** — `isCall`, `isRet`, `isJump`, `isConditional` flags now correctly detect ARM64 branch instructions: `blr`/`blraa`/`blrab`, `bx lr`/`retaa`/`retab`/`pop {pc}`, dot-notation (`b.eq`, `b.ne`), `cbz`/`cbnz`/`tbz`/`tbnz`, `br`, and ARM32 conditional branches (`beq`, `bne`, `bhi`, etc.).
- **STP x29,x30 encoding mask** — prolog scanner mask was `0xFFFF83FF` (included imm7 bits), changed to `0xFC407FFF` to match any addressing mode and offset.
- **Trampoline/thunk following** — `analyzeFunction` now follows unconditional jump targets as new functions (entry point trampolines like `b #target` were previously dead-ends).
- **Race condition in recursive analysis** — `analyzeFunction` fired off child BL target analysis without `await`, causing floating promises. Functions discovered via calls were missing from reports. Now properly awaits all child targets before returning.

### Added

- **ARM64/ARM32 function prolog scanning** — `scanForFunctionPrologs` detects STP x29,x30 (any addressing mode), SUB SP,SP, PACIASP (ARM64), PUSH {lr}/STR LR,[SP] (ARM32).
- **ARM64 function end detection** — architecture-aware: ARM64 NOP (`0xD503201F`), ARM32 NOP, UDF padding, and ARM prolog boundaries.
- **ARM64/ARM32 fallback disassembly** — `decodeARM64Fallback` (NOP, RET, BL, B, B.cond, CBZ/CBNZ, STP, LDP, BLR, BR) and `decodeARM32Fallback` (NOP, BX LR, POP {pc}, BL, B, PUSH).
- **ARM64 stack string detection** — `stackStringDetector` scans for STRB/STR opcodes with SP/FP base register, backward search for MOVZ loading ASCII values.
- **ARM64 DebugEngine** (5 methods):
  - `setupArm64Stack()` — LR=0xDEAD0000 sentinel, 16-byte SP alignment
  - `initializeElfProcessStack()` — argc/argv/envp via X0/X1/X2 (register-based)
  - `installSyscallHandler()` — SVC #0 interception (intno===2), X8=syscall number
  - `updateEmulationRegisters()` — x0-x15, fp, sp, pc, nzcv mapping
  - `popReturnAddress()` — reads LR (X30) instead of stack pop
  - 20+ ARM64 Linux syscalls: write(64), exit(93), exit_group(94), brk(214), mmap(222), openat(56), close(57), fstat(80), ioctl(29), readlinkat(78), etc.
- **ARM64 formulaBuilder** — register recognition (x0-x30, w0-w30, sp, lr, fp, xzr, wzr, pc, r0-r15), `#` prefix handling, 15 ARM mnemonics (movz, movk, movn, mul, madd, msub, neg, eor, orr, and, lsl, lsr, asr, mla, mvn), 3-operand instruction form support.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-15 - "Fortification"

> **Security & Stability Release** — Full codebase audit across all 18 HexCore extensions. CSP hardening, memory safety, input validation, and crash prevention.

### Security

- **CSP nonce-based script injection** — hexviewer and peanalyzer webviews now use `nonce-<random>` instead of `'unsafe-inline'` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **ReDoS prevention** — base64 scanner regex bounded to `{20,4096}` (was unbounded `{20,}`).
- **Output path validation** — hashcalc and filetype `output.path` restricted to workspace or user home directory, preventing arbitrary file writes.
- **File size limit** — disassembler engine rejects files >512MB before `readFileSync` to prevent OOM crashes.

### Fixed

- **Unicorn hook memory leaks** — replaced raw `new`/`delete` with `std::unique_ptr` RAII in 5 hook callback allocations (`unicorn_wrapper.cpp`).
- **Strings offset carryover bug** — fixed incorrect offset calculation in chunked extraction that caused reported offsets to drift.
- **Base64 streaming** — replaced `readFileSync` with chunked streaming (1MB chunks + 4KB overlap) to handle large files without loading entire file into memory.
- **Remill crash prevention** — added try/catch in C++ `DoLift` and `LiftBytesWorker::Execute` (was aborting process due to `NAPI_DISABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS`).
- **Remill semantics path resolution** — `GetModuleHandleA` now tries both `hexcore_remill.node` and `hexcore-remill.node` naming conventions.
- **Capstone ARM/ARM64 sync/async detail parity** — sync path now includes `mem`, `shift`, `vectorIndex`, `subtracted`, `ext`, `vas` fields matching async output.
- **Capstone error handling** — `numInsns == 0` with `CS_ERR_OK` is now treated as valid (empty input), added null guard on `cs_free`.

### Changed

- **Truncation warnings** — hexviewer search results (50 limit) and peanalyzer suspicious strings (20 limit) now show "Showing X of Y" when truncated.
- **Native module naming** — all 4 engines (Capstone, Remill, Unicorn, LLVM MC) now try both underscore and hyphen naming conventions for prebuilds.
- **`.vscodeignore` hardening** — added `!prebuilds/**` force-include to Capstone, Unicorn, LLVM MC, and better-sqlite3 to ensure prebuilds survive packaging.

### npm Packages Published

| Package | Version |
|---------|---------|
| hexcore-capstone | 1.3.2 |
| hexcore-remill | 0.1.1 |
| hexcore-unicorn | 1.2.0 |

## [3.4.1] - 2026-02-14

> **Fix Release** — hexcore-remill packaging fix: promoted from experimental to production engine in CI/CD pipeline.

### Fixed
- **hexcore-remill not included in packaged builds** — the native module worked in dev mode but was missing from the installer output. Added to `nativeExtensions` in build system.
- **Prebuild workflow** — moved hexcore-remill from experimental matrix to main prebuild matrix alongside Capstone, Unicorn, LLVM MC, and better-sqlite3.
- **Semantics packaging** — added dedicated semantics tarball (`remill-semantics-win32-x64.tar.gz`) to prebuild workflow for LLVM IR .bc files required at runtime.
- **Installer workflow** — added hexcore-remill prebuild fetch + semantics download for Windows and Linux builds.

### Changed
- Experimental prebuild matrix now only contains hexcore-rellic (future).
- Updated GitHub Actions versions in experimental job (v4 → v6).
- `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` — hexcore-remill moved from "Future Engines (Research)" to Infrastructure (#20).

## [3.2.0-preview] - 2026-02-08 - "Linux Awakening"

> **Preview Release** - Major update introducing Linux ELF emulation, headless automation pipeline,
> and sweeping improvements across all analysis extensions. Tested against real CTF binaries (HTB).

### Added

#### hexcore-debugger v2.1.0: Full Linux ELF Emulation
- **PIE binary support** - Automatic detection of ET_DYN (Position Independent Executables) with conventional base address (`0x555555554000` for x64, `0x56555000` for x86)
- **PLT/GOT resolution** - Parse `.rela.plt` (JUMP_SLOT) and `.rela.dyn` (GLOB_DAT) relocations, create API stubs, patch GOT entries for full import interception
- **Direct GOT call support** - Handle modern `-fno-plt` style binaries that use `call [rip+GOT]` instead of PLT stubs
- **40+ Linux API hooks** with System V AMD64 ABI argument reading (RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9):
  - I/O: `puts`, `printf`, `fprintf`, `sprintf`, `snprintf`, `write`, `read`
  - String: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcmp`, `strncmp`, `strstr`, `strchr`, `strrchr`, `strtok`
  - Memory: `memcpy`, `memset`, `memcmp`, `memmove`
  - Heap: `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`
  - Conversion: `strtol`, `strtoul`, `atoi`, `atol`
  - Process: `exit`, `abort`, `getpid`, `getuid`, `getenv`, `__libc_start_main`
  - Time: `time`, `gettimeofday`, `clock_gettime`, `sleep`, `usleep`
  - File stubs: `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fseek`, `ftell`
  - Security: `__stack_chk_fail`
- **Linux syscall handler** - Intercept `syscall` instruction for: read, write, close, mmap, brk, getpid, getuid, arch_prctl, exit, exit_group
- **TLS/FS_BASE setup** - Automatic Thread Local Storage with stack canary at `fs:[0x28]` for GCC `-fstack-protector` binaries
- **`__libc_start_main` -> `main()` redirect** - Skip CRT init, jump directly to `main()` with argc/argv/envp
- **stdin emulation** - Configurable input buffer for `scanf`, `read(0)`, `getchar`, `fgets` with format specifier parsing (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`, `%c`, `%u`)
- **API redirect loop** - Transparent handling of multiple API calls during `continue()` with safety limit
- **New modules**: `linuxApiHooks.ts`, `elfLoader.ts`, `peLoader.ts`, `memoryManager.ts`, `winApiHooks.ts`
- **New commands**: `hexcore.debug.setStdin` for ELF stdin input, `hexcore.debug.unicornStatus` for engine diagnostics

#### hexcore-debugger: Emulation Engine Fixes
- **Fixed step stalling** - Removed `stepMode` flag, use Unicorn native `count=1` for reliable single-step
- **Fixed continue with breakpoint** - `isFirstInstruction` flag + `notifyApiRedirect()` prevents stub corruption
- **Fixed RIP=0x0 on continue** - `.rela.dyn` (GLOB_DAT) parsing ensures direct GOT calls are intercepted
- **Fixed isRunning state** - `getEmulationState()` correctly reports `isRunning=true` after load with new `isReady` field
- **RIP sync after emuStop** - `syncCurrentAddress()` reads actual RIP from Unicorn registers
- **`fs_base`/`gs_base` register support** in `setRegister()` for TLS segment access
- **`arch_prctl` syscall** now actually sets FS/GS base (was no-op before)

#### hexcore-disassembler v1.2.0: ELF Deep Analysis & Headless Mode
- **PIE detection** - Detect `ET_DYN` ELF type, auto-select base address
- **PLT/GOT parsing** - Resolve import function addresses via `.rela.plt`
- **Section/symbol address adjustment** for PIE base offset
- **PIE characteristic flag** - File info shows `['ELF', 'PIE']`
- **Headless `analyzeAll`** - Deep analysis with JSON/MD output for automation
- **Function summary export** - Address, name, size, instruction count, callers/callees

#### Automation Pipeline System (NEW)
- **Pipeline Runner** (`automationPipelineRunner.ts`) - Execute `.hexcore_job.json` job files with step-by-step headless execution
- **Command**: `hexcore.pipeline.runJob` - Run automation jobs manually or auto-trigger on file creation
- **Workspace watcher** - Auto-detects `.hexcore_job.json` in workspace
- **Step controls** - Per-step timeout, error handling, output validation
- **Status tracking** - `hexcore-pipeline.status.json` and `hexcore-pipeline.log` output
- **Extension preflight** - Auto-activates extensions before pipeline steps

#### All Analysis Extensions: Headless Mode
Every analysis tool now supports headless execution via standardized parameters:

| Extension | Command | Headless Parameters |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **File Type** | `hexcore.filetype.detect` | `file`, `output`, `quiet` |
| **Hash Calculator** | `hexcore.hashcalc.calculate` | `file`, `algorithms`, `output`, `quiet` |
| **Entropy** | `hexcore.entropy.analyze` | `file`, `blockSize`, `output`, `quiet` |
| **Strings** | `hexcore.strings.extract` | `file`, `minLength`, `maxStrings`, `output`, `quiet` |
| **PE Analyzer** | `hexcore.peanalyzer.analyze` | `file`, `output`, `quiet` |
| **Disassembler** | `hexcore.disasm.analyzeAll` | `file`, `output`, `quiet` |

- All commands support JSON and Markdown output formats
- Backward-compatible aliases: `hexcore.hash.file`, `hexcore.hash.calculate`, `hexcore.pe.analyze`, `hexcore.disasm.open`

#### SKILL.md: Complete Technical API Documentation
- Full emulator memory layout with addresses (STUB_BASE, TEB, PEB, heap, stack, TLS)
- Complete DebugEngine, PE Loader, ELF Loader, Memory Manager API reference
- 25+ Windows API hooks table, 40+ Linux API hooks table, 12 syscall handlers
- Unicorn Wrapper API with all methods and types
- WebView message protocol and troubleshooting guides

### Changed
- `elfLoader.ts` completely rewritten with PIE support, PLT stub creation, and dual `.rela.plt`/`.rela.dyn` GOT patching
- `unicornWrapper.ts` overhauled with API redirect loop, state sync, and `EmulationState.isReady` field
- `debugEngine.ts` updated with ELF loading flow, TLS setup, stdin buffer, and state management
- `disassemblerEngine.ts` updated with inline PE/ELF parsing, function prolog scan, and string xrefs
- `capstoneWrapper.ts` improved with instruction type analysis (call/jump/ret/conditional detection)
- `llvmMcWrapper.ts` improved with multi-arch assembly support and NOP padding
- All analysis extensions refactored with consistent headless APIs

### Known Issues (Preview)
- Deep stepping (~400+ steps) may encounter `UC_ERR_FETCH_PROT` on some code paths
- File I/O hooks (`fopen`, `fread`, etc.) are stubs returning error codes
- No dynamic linker emulation (imports resolved statically via GOT patching)
- `.hexcore_job.json` is auto-generated by AI agents - not committed to repository

## [3.1.1] - 2026-02-03 - "Stability Pass"

### Added
- Native engine availability diagnostics for Disassembler and Debugger (Capstone/LLVM MC/Unicorn).
- Shared native module loader in `hexcore-common` with consistent error reporting.
- Postinstall native prebuild installer (`scripts/hexcore-native-install.js`) and Windows prebuild workflow.
- `engines.vscode` metadata for native engine packages to prevent extension host load errors.
- Function selector in the large disassembly editor for quick navigation.

### Fixed
- Disassembler PE analysis now passes file path (not buffer) and awaits results so Sections/Imports/Exports render.
- Large disassembly editor navigation now selects the containing function for a target address.
- Default function selection prefers entry point or first non-empty function instead of empty stubs.

### Changed
- Hardened native engine loading paths for Capstone/LLVM MC/Unicorn to improve portability.
