# VS Code Agents Instructions

This file provides instructions for AI coding agents working with the VS Code codebase.

> Transition note: this repository is now **HikariSystem Scylla Studio**, a pentest-focused sister product to HexCore. Any HexCore-specific references below describe the donor codebase and current implementation reality, not the intended long-term product identity. Prefer Scylla branding and pentest-oriented scope for new work unless a task explicitly targets legacy HexCore components during migration.

## Project Overview

**HikariSystem HexCore** is a specialized IDE for malware analysis and reverse engineering, built on the VS Code foundation with custom extensions designed for security professionals. It combines the full power of VS Code with dedicated tools for binary file analysis, PE executable parsing, cryptographic hash calculation, and string extraction.

### Key Features

- **PE Analyzer** - Comprehensive Portable Executable analysis for Windows binaries
- **Hash Calculator** - Fast file hashing with algorithm selection
- **Strings Extractor** - Extract and categorize strings with memory-efficient streaming
- **Entropy Analyzer** - Visual entropy analysis for detecting packed or encrypted regions
- **Base64 Decoder** - Detect and decode Base64 encoded strings in binary files
- **File Type Detector** - Identify true file type using magic bytes signature detection

### NEW in v2.0
- **Disassembler** - Professional disassembly with Capstone engine (x86/x64/ARM)
- **AI Assistant** - Kimi AI integration for automated analysis and CTF help
- **Debugger** - Dynamic analysis with WinDbg/GDB integration
- **YARA Scanner** - Malware detection using YARA rules

## Code Style Guidelines

### Indentation
- **Use tabs, not spaces**

### Naming Conventions
- Use `PascalCase` for `type` names
- Use `PascalCase` for `enum` values
- Use `camelCase` for `function` and `method` names
- Use `camelCase` for `property` names and `local variables`
- Use whole words in names when possible

### Types
- Do not export `types` or `functions` unless you need to share it across multiple components
- Do not introduce new `types` or `values` to the global namespace
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` as types unless absolutely necessary

### Comments
- Use JSDoc style comments for `functions`, `interfaces`, `enums`, and `classes`
- All comments should be in English

### Strings
- Use "double quotes" for strings shown to the user that need to be externalized (localized)
- Use 'single quotes' otherwise
- All strings visible to the user need to be externalized using the `vs/nls` module
- Externalized strings must not use string concatenation. Use placeholders instead (`{0}`)

### UI Labels
- Use title-style capitalization for command labels, buttons and menu items (each word is capitalized)
- Don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters unless it's the first or last word (e.g. "in", "with", "for")

### Style
- Use arrow functions `=>` over anonymous function expressions
- Only surround arrow function parameters when necessary
- Always surround loop and conditional bodies with curly braces
- Open curly braces always go on the same line as whatever necessitates them
- Parenthesized constructs should have no surrounding whitespace
- Prefer `async` and `await` over `Promise` and `then` calls
- Prefer `export function x() {}` over `export const x = () => {}` in top-level scopes for better stack traces

### Code Quality
- All files must include Microsoft copyright header
- Prefer regex capture groups with names over numbered capture groups
- Never duplicate imports - reuse existing imports if present
- Do not duplicate code - look for existing utility functions before implementing new functionality
- When adding file watching, prefer correlated file watchers (via fileService.createWatcher)
- When adding tooltips to UI elements, prefer the use of IHoverService service

---

## Validating TypeScript Changes

**MANDATORY**: Always check the `VS Code - Build` watch task output for compilation errors before running ANY script or declaring work complete.

- NEVER run tests if there are compilation errors
- Monitor the `VS Code - Build` task outputs for real-time compilation errors
- This task runs `Core - Build` and `Ext - Build` to incrementally compile VS Code TypeScript sources and built-in extensions

### TypeScript Validation Commands
```bash
# Check for layering issues
npm run valid-layers-check

# Monaco typecheck
npm run monaco-compile-check

# Security compile check
npm run tsec-compile-check

# Define class fields check
npm run define-class-fields-check
```

---

## Finding Related Code

1. **Semantic search first**: Use file search for general concepts
2. **Grep for exact strings**: Use grep for error messages or specific function names
3. **Follow imports**: Check what files import the problematic module
4. **Check test files**: Often reveal usage patterns and expected behavior

---

## Extension Development Guidelines

### Creating a New Extension
1. Copy an existing HexCore extension as a template
2. Update `package.json` with new name, commands, and contribution points
3. Implement functionality in `src/extension.ts`
4. Add to `.github/workflows/hexcore-build.yml` workflow
5. Update documentation

### Extension Best Practices
- Use streaming for large files (64KB chunks recommended)
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations
- Generate Markdown reports for analysis results
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Prefer Node.js built-ins over third-party dependencies
- Use virtual scrolling for large file viewers

---

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

### Workflows
- `.github/workflows/hexcore-build.yml` - Builds all HexCore extensions and runs linting
- `.github/workflows/hexcore-installer.yml` - Creates Windows installer packages
- `.github/workflows/hexcore-native-prebuilds.yml` - Builds native engine prebuilds (Capstone, Unicorn, LLVM MC, better-sqlite3, Remill)
- `.github/workflows/telemetry.yml` - Telemetry-related checks

### Build Matrix
- Platform: Ubuntu (for extension builds), Windows (for installer)
- Node.js: 18.x

---

## Security Considerations

- All user facing messages must be localized using the applicable localization framework
- When handling binary files, validate file signatures before processing
- Use streaming processing for large files to avoid memory issues
- Sanitize any user input that may be displayed in UI
- Be cautious with file system operations - validate paths

---

## Product Configuration

The `product.json` file defines the product branding:
- Application name: "HexCore"
- Full name: "HikariSystem HexCore"
- Data folder: `.hexcore`
- Protocol: `hexcore://`
